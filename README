This is a (old, pre-v3) Firefox plugin to show Horde's Trean bookmarks directly
in the browser.  As I remember it, it worked at one time.  I'm not sure whether
to be proud or uneasy with the kludge that it is.  It hooked the bookmarks
component and mixed in the Trean bookmarks, which is either clever or insane.
I'm still somewhat interested in finishing something like this since I like
the idea of synced bookmarks but am not fond of the cloud. However, these
days I use Google Chrome.

I started it in pursuit of a bounty, that no longer appears to be offered.
There's an issue open at http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/2565 with information
about the development of this plugin. If that's still accurate, it appears
nobody has finished a Trean plugin.
